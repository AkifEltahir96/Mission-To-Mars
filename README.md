# Mission To Mars
The purpose of this activity is to create a web app that includes pictures of Mars. Specifically, we want to scrape pictures of Mars' hemispheres from a website. We will use a variety of tools (BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Mongo, Flask) to scrape full-resoultion images, store the data in a database, and display and alter the images on a web app for the most appealing view.
